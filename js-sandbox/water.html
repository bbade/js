physics notes

f=ma   OR   a=f/m

v' = v+a*dt

if velocity is changing over time, you can estimate the updated position based off averaging velocities
p1 = p0 + 0.5 * (v0 + v1) * dt


Gravity between two objects
f = G* [(m1m2)/(D^2)]


Spring force is determined by difference between a spring's rest length and current length
Fs = Ks(Lc - Lx)   // spring force = spring constant * (length_current - length_rest)


A "Damper" is a force that resists spring motion, or motion between objects

Viscosity is resistance to moving things through a medium such as air or water

Momentum is coonserved, adn can be used to solve for other forces

Torque is the rotational equivalent of force.

Using function computeProjectedBounds(canvas: HTMLCanvasElement) {


as a guide, write a function worldToScreenMatrix. This will produce a matrix that will allow converting from world
